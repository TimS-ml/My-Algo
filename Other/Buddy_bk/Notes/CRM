Today I studied the customer relationship management
The goal of CRM is based on resources allocaiton differently to different customer to increase customer value to the firm. 

market share=firm's sales/sales of all firms (for product focus marketing approach)
sales growth= increse or decrease of sales volum or sale value in the previous period of time (current health of a firm)

acquisition rate=the prospective acquired/prospects targeted (can define different level of acquition, campaign by campaign)
acquisition cost=acquisition spending/ number of prospects qcquired 

2 reasons for customer activity metrics: 1.knowing customer insight;2.contribute to custoemr caluation model
average inter-purchase time=1/number of purchase during a prespecified period
retention (and defectionï¼‰ rate (Rr)= customer in cohort buying in time period/total of customer in cohort buying in a period of time
life time duration=1/1-Rr
Survival rate (t) = retention rate * survival rate(t-1)
lifetime duration=number of retented customer in time period / cohort size
