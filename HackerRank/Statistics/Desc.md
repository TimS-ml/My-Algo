When independent random variables are added, their properly normalized **sum** tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) **even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed**

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.
This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.
