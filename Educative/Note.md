Only the python solution contains the time complexity stuffs
For problem set, write down thought process first

# Patterns: Sliding Window
2 pointers, fixed / unfixed gap

state related: hash dict

string + parameters

fix size, find max sum sub arr
fix sum, find shortest size sub arr
fix `<= k` distinct character, find longest size sub arr
allow distinct character, no repeat, find longest size sub arr


## Key
fixed size or dynamic size ?
  - relationship to the parameters ? How to def start and end ?
  - if dynamic, when to shrink ? when to stop shrink ?
define of start and end ?
freq dict or index dict ?
