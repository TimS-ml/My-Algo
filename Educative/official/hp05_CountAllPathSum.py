# Code Explain:
- Time complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(N)

# Pros and Cons and Notation:

This problem follows the Binary Tree Path Sum pattern. We can follow the same DFS approach. But there will be four differences:
- We will keep track of the current path in a list which will be passed to every recursive call.
- Whenever we traverse a node we will do two things:
    - Add the current node to the current path.
    - As we added a new node to the current path, we should find the sums of all sub-paths ending at the current node. If the sum of any sub-path is equal to ‘S’ we will increment our path count.
- We will traverse all paths and will not stop processing after finding the first path.
- Remove the current node from the current path before returning from the function. This is needed to *Backtrack* while we are going up the recursive call stack to process other paths.
