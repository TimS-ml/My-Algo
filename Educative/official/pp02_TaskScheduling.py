There are ‘N’ tasks, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. 
Each task can have some prerequisite tasks which need to be completed before it can be scheduled. 
Given the number of tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs, find out if it is possible to schedule all the tasks.

# Code Explain:
- Time complexity: O(V + E)
- Space complexity: O(V + E)

Similar Problems
Course Schedule: There are ‘N’ courses, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. 
Each course can have some prerequisite courses which need to be completed before it can be taken. 
Given the number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, find if it is possible for a student to take all the courses.

Solution: This problem is exactly similar to our parent problem. In this problem, we have courses instead of tasks.
